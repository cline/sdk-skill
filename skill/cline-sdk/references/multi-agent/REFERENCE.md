# Multi-Agent Coordination

The Cline SDK supports two models for multi-agent work: sub-agents (parent-child) and teams (peer-to-peer).

## Sub-Agents vs Teams

| Feature | Sub-Agents | Teams |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Enable with | `enableSpawnAgent: true` | `enableAgentTeams: true` |
| Persistence | Session-scoped only | Across sessions |
| Coordination | Parent-child hierarchy | Peer-to-peer |
| Shared state | None | Task board, mailbox, mission log |
| Best for | One-off delegation | Complex multi-session projects |

## Sub-Agents

Sub-agents are spawned by a parent agent during a run. They execute independently and report results back.

### Enabling Sub-Agents

```typescript
const cline = await ClineCore.create({ clientName: "my-app" })

await cline.start({
  prompt: "Refactor the auth module and update tests",
  config: {
    providerId: "anthropic",
    modelId: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful coding agent.",
    enableSpawnAgent: true,
    enableAgentTeams: false,
    enableTools: true,
  },
})
```

When `enableSpawnAgent` is true, the agent gets access to sub-agent tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `spawn_agent` | Run a delegated task with a focused sub-agent |

### How Sub-Agents Work

1. The parent agent decides a subtask can be delegated
2. It calls `spawn_agent` with a focused system prompt and task description
3. The sub-agent runs independently in the background
4. The parent can check status or send follow-up messages
5. Sub-agent results are available to the parent when complete

## Teams

Teams provide persistent, cross-session coordination between agents.

### Enabling Teams

```typescript
await cline.start({
  prompt: "Coordinate the auth sprint",
  config: {
    providerId: "anthropic",
    modelId: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    systemPrompt: "You coordinate a team of agents.",
    enableSpawnAgent: true,
    enableAgentTeams: true,
    teamName: "auth-sprint",
    enableTools: true,
  },
})
```

### Team Tools

When `enableAgentTeams` is true, the coordinator agent gets:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `team_spawn_teammate` | Create a new agent with a role and task |
| `team_shutdown_teammate` | Shut down a teammate agent |
| `team_task` | Create, update, or inspect team tasks |
| `team_run_task` | Start a run for a teammate task |
| `team_cancel_run` | Cancel a teammate run |
| `team_status` | Inspect team and teammate status |
| `team_list_runs` | List teammate runs |
| `team_await_runs` | Wait for selected runs |
| `team_send_message` | Send a mailbox message |
| `team_broadcast` | Broadcast a mailbox message |
| `team_read_mailbox` | Read team mailbox messages |
| `team_mission_log` | Append or read mission log entries |
| `team_cleanup` | Clean up team state |
| `team_create_outcome` | Create an outcome record |
| `team_attach_outcome_fragment` | Attach a fragment to an outcome |
| `team_review_outcome_fragment` | Review an outcome fragment |
| `team_finalize_outcome` | Finalize an outcome |
| `team_list_outcomes` | List outcome records |

### Team Persistence

Teams store shared state in:

```
~/.cline/data/
```

Team state is persisted by the ClineCore session and team stores. Treat the storage layout as an implementation detail and use the team tools or session APIs instead of reading files directly.

### CLI Team Access

```bash
cline --team-name auth-sprint "Continue the auth refactor"
```

## Choosing Between Sub-Agents and Teams

Use sub-agents when:
- You need one-off parallel execution within a single session
- Tasks are independent and don't need to communicate with each other
- Results only matter to the parent agent

Use teams when:
- Work spans multiple sessions over time
- Agents need to coordinate and share progress
- Tasks have dependencies between them
- You want a persistent record of multi-agent collaboration

## Patterns

### Parallel Research with Sub-Agents

A parent agent spawns multiple sub-agents to research different topics simultaneously:

```typescript
await cline.start({
  prompt: `Research these three topics in parallel:
    1. Current best practices for JWT auth
    2. OAuth 2.0 provider comparison
    3. Session management patterns
    Spawn a sub-agent for each topic, then synthesize the results.`,
  config: {
    enableSpawnAgent: true,
    enableAgentTeams: false,
    enableTools: true,
    // ...
  },
})
```

### Team Sprint

A coordinator manages a multi-session project:

```typescript
await cline.start({
  prompt: `You are the coordinator for the auth-sprint team.
    Review the task board and delegate the next highest-priority task
    to a teammate. Check status on any in-progress tasks.`,
  config: {
    enableAgentTeams: true,
    enableSpawnAgent: true,
    teamName: "auth-sprint",
    enableTools: true,
    // ...
  },
})
```
